# React Query

```html copy /npm/
npm i @tanstack/react-query
```

```html copy /pnpm/
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query
```

```html copy /yarn/
yarn add @tanstack/react-query
```

### How to implement ?

Create a Custom Query Client Provider.
By default, all components in Next.js 13 are rendered on the server but React Query doesn’t work with Server Components. Therefore, we need to create a custom provider that will render the QueryClientProvider within a Client Component.
To ensure that the custom provider component only renders on the client-side, we can add <b>"use client";</b> at the top of the file. This tells the server to skip rendering the custom provider component and render it only on the client-side.
To create this component, navigate to the ‘src‘ directory and create a new folder named ‘utils‘. Inside the ‘utils‘ folder, create a file named provider.tsx and add the following code.
