# Setup GitHub

To setup github you need to create git repo first. Then you need to copy the repo urls. Example

`https://github.com/jahidul31/test.git`

Then you need to run this command.

```html copy
git remote add origin https://github.com/jahidul31/test.git
```

```html copy /git/
git branch -M main
```

```html copy /git/
git push -u origin main
```
